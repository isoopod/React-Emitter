Class components are not supported. The basic use case is to use useEmitter, to which you set up the properties like you would a Particle Emitter.  local React = require(Packages.React) local ReactEmitter = require(Packages.ReactEmitter) local e = React.createElement local function App() local emitter = ReactEmitter.useEmitter({ Size = NumberSequence.new(0.2), ShapeDimensions = Vector2.new(50, 50), }) return e(&quot;Frame&quot;, { Size = UDim2.fromOffset(50, 50), }, { Particles = e(ReactEmitter.ParticleRenderer, { Emitter = emitter }) }) end   The default properties for an Emitter are based off the defaults for Particle Emitters. An important deviation is the introduction of ShapeDimensions, which sets the spawn area for particles. This is also used as the size of the ParticleRenderer by default, but this can be overridden through the native field. Do note that this only goes one way, and the ShapeDimensions of the Emitter will not be influenced by a custom size on a ParticleRenderer. The size of the particles is relative to the size of the ParticleRenderer, so there are cases where you would want the ShapeDimensions of the Emitter to be different to the Size of the ParticleRenderer.  Because emitters are completely separate to the particle renderers, you will often need a way to set ShapeDimensions to the absolute size of the intended ParticleRenderer. Here is a simple way to do that:  local function App() local containerSize, setContainerSize = React.useState(Vector2.zero) local emitter = ReactEmitter.useEmitter({ Size = NumberSequence.new(0.2), ShapeDimensions = containerSize, }) return e(&quot;Frame&quot;, { Size = UDim2.fromOffset(50, 50), [React.Change.AbsoluteSize] = function(rbx: Frame) setContainerSize(rbx.AbsoluteSize) end, }, { Particles = e(ReactEmitter.ParticleRenderer, { Emitter = emitter }) }) end  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Types​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ReactEmitter","url":"/React-Emitter/api/ReactEmitter#types","content":" ","version":null,"tagName":"h2"},{"title":"NormalId2D​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ReactEmitter","url":"/React-Emitter/api/ReactEmitter#NormalId2D","content":"&lt;/&gt; type NormalId2D = &quot;Top&quot; | &quot;Right&quot; | &quot;Bottom&quot; | &quot;Left&quot; Used for Emission Direction on the Rectangle shape.

Brightness: number-- [1] How bright this particle appears. Note that since ImageLabels do not get brighter at RGB values above 255, this has limited use. Color: ColorSequence -- [255, 255, 255] The Color of each particle over its lifetime. Use ColorSequence.new(Color3.new(r, g, b)) for a solid color. Drag: number-- [0] Determines the rate in seconds particles lose half their speed through exponential decay. Setting to negative will cause particles' velocity to grow exponentially. EmissionDirection: NormalId2D-- [Top] Face of the emitter to emit from when Shape is Rectangle. Enabled: boolean-- [true] Will emit particles at Rate * TimeScale per second when enabled. Particles can be manually emitted on a disbled emitter with the imperative API. FlipbookFramerate: NumberRange -- [1] Determines how fast the flipbook texture animates in frames per second. Applies to FlipbookModes Loop and Random. FlipbookImageSize: Vector2 -- [1024, 1024] The dimensions of the actual image. FlipbookLayout: ParticleFlipbookLayout -- [None] Determines the layout of the flipbook texture. FlipbookMode: ParticleFlipbookMode -- [Loop] Determines the type of the flipbook animation.

FlipbookSizeY: number-- [1] the number of rows in the flipbook texture when using FlipbookMode Custom.

Lifetime: NumberRange -- [5, 10] Defines a random range of ages for newly emitted particles. Particles will despawn after their age passes their lifetime. Rate: number-- [20] How many particles to emit per second (at TimeScale 1) when the Emitter is enabled. Goes to 200, but be careful because UI particles are a lot more expensive than ParticleEmitters. Rotation: NumberRange -- [0] Defines a random range of rotations in degrees for the particle to start at. RotSpeed: NumberRange -- [0] Determines the range of angular speeds of emitted particles, measured in degrees per second. Shape: ParticleEmitterShape2D-- [Rectangle] 2D Shape of the emitter, either Rectangle (like Box) or Annulus (like Cylinder, Disc, or Sphere). ShapeDimensions: Vector2 -- [1, 1] Absolute size of the emitter. A React State can be helpful for this. ShapeInOut: Enum.ParticleEmitterShapeInOut-- [Outward] Selects whether particles emit outward only, inward only, or in both dimensions. ShapePartial: number-- [1] For Annulus shapes, a multiplier between [0, 1] for the inner radius relative to the outer radius, where 1 is a full circle and 0 is the perimeter. ShapeStyle: ParticleEmitterShapeStyle2D-- [Area] If particles should spawn in the whole area of the shape or just on the perimeter of the shape. Size: NumberSequence -- [1] Determines the relative size over individual particles' lifetimes. Use NumberSequence.new(n) for a single size. Size is relative to the ParticleRenderer (relative to the larger of the two dimensions). Speed: NumberRange -- [5] A range of speeds for the particle to start at. Can be set negative to have the particle go backwards. SpreadAngle: number-- [0] A number determining the degrees either side of the emission direction to randomly offset the starting direction of particles by.

TimeScale: number-- [1] Multiplier to how fast particles are simulated. Allows for values outside the range [0, 1]. Applies to rate as well.
